    <h1>Welcome to the movie ranking!</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>The top 3 movies are : </h2>
    <h3>1. Now you see me (2013) :</h3>
    <h4>This is one of my favourite magician movie of all time!<br>
        This movie revolves around a revenge which a guy has<br>
        to take on a rich businessman, where he uses 4 great<br>
        magicians to make his revenge successful.
    </h4>
    <h3>2. Doctor strange (2016) :</h3>
    <h4>Being a huge fan of Marvel comics, this is one of the best<br>
    among them all.  A doctor, who has met with an accident,<br>
    seeks help from a place called Kamar taj, where he faces<br>
    many vulnerabilities in multiverse. This movie has a mind<br>
    bending vfx what will keep the audience in awe.
    </h4>
    <h3>3. Queen : </h3>
    <h4>This is a movie about a heartbroken woman who's fianace<br>
    cancels the wedding. She goes to a solo trip to New york<br>
    and Paris, which made her realise that there is much more<br>
    in the world to explore, with friends rather than being<br>
    heartbroken.
